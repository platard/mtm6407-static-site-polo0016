# 4-8 Months: Growing and Learning

During these months, your baby will start showing more of their personality. It's a time for physical growth and cognitive development.

## Sleep Schedule
As your baby grows, their sleep patterns begin to consolidate. Most babies this age need about 14-15 hours of sleep a day.

- **Months 4-5**: Nighttime sleep stretches might last 6-8 hours, with 2-3 naps during the day.
- **Months 6-8**: Expect more regular sleep patterns, with longer night sleeps and 2-3 consistent naps.

## Wake Windows
Your baby's ability to stay awake for longer periods increases.

- **Months 4-5**: Awake for about 1.5-2.5 hours between naps.
- **Months 6-8**: Awake windows extend to 2-3 hours.

## Feeding Routine
This period may include the introduction of solid foods, alongside breast milk or formula.

- **Months 4-6**: Start with single-grain cereals, pureed vegetables, and fruits.
- **Months 7-8**: More variety can be introduced, including softer, mashed foods.

Always introduce new foods one at a time and watch for any allergic reactions.

## Developmental Milestones
- **Motor Skills**: Rolling over, sitting without support, and maybe starting to crawl.
- **Communication**: Babbling, laughing, and increased responsiveness to sounds and people.

Enjoy this exciting phase as your baby explores and interacts more with the world!
