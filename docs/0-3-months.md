# 0-3 Months: New Beginnings

The first three months of a baby's life are a period of rapid development and adjustment, both for the baby and the parents. Here's what you need to know to navigate this exciting time.

## Sleep Schedule
In the first three months, babies typically sleep a lot, around 14 to 17 hours a day. However, they don't stay asleep for long periods due to their small stomachs needing frequent feedings.

- **Weeks 1-2**: Newborns sleep in short bursts of 2-4 hours.
- **Weeks 3-6**: Sleep stretches might extend to 4-5 hours.
- **Weeks 7-12**: Some babies start sleeping for longer stretches at night, up to 6 hours, but this varies greatly.

## Wake Windows
Wake windows refer to the time a baby is awake between naps. For 0-3 months old babies, wake windows are typically short.

- **Weeks 1-2**: Wake windows might last 45-60 minutes.
- **Weeks 3-6**: Gradually increase to 60-90 minutes.
- **Weeks 7-12**: Generally, 1.5 hours of awake time is ideal.

## Feeding Routine
Newborns need to be fed frequently, typically every 2-3 hours, including overnight.

- **Breastfeeding**: On-demand feeding is common, but you can also look for hunger cues every 2-3 hours.
- **Bottle Feeding**: Newborns may take 2-3 ounces of formula every 2-3 hours.

Remember, each baby is unique, and these are general guidelines. Always consult with your pediatrician for personalized advice.
