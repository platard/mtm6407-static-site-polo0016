# 9-12 Months: Preparing for Toddlerhood

The last quarter of the first year is filled with rapid development. Your baby is becoming more mobile and expressive.

## Sleep Schedule
Most babies at this age need about 14 hours of sleep a day, with longer nighttime sleep and fewer naps.

- **Months 9-10**: Nighttime sleep can extend up to 11 hours with 2 naps during the day.
- **Months 11-12**: Some babies might transition to 1 longer nap during the day.

## Wake Windows
Your baby can stay awake for longer periods, typically around 3-4 hours between sleeps.

## Feeding Routine
As your baby approaches their first birthday, they'll be eating more solids and possibly transitioning from breast milk or formula to cow's milk.

- **Solid Foods**: Offer a variety of soft foods cut into small pieces.
- **Self-Feeding**: Encourage self-feeding with finger foods to develop motor skills.

## Developmental Milestones
- **Physical**: Crawling, pulling to stand, and maybe taking first steps.
- **Social and Emotional**: Developing a sense of independence, preference for familiar people, and possible separation anxiety.

Remember, each child develops at their own pace. Celebrate your baby's milestones and enjoy this special time!
